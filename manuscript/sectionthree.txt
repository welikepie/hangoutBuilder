# Section Three: Uploading your Secure Content

In this tutorial, we will be using **Git** & **Google Code** to upload and store your secure content. However, there are other options available such as [Amazon Web Services](http://www.aws.amazon.com).

**3.1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/)**

Download and install Git to your machine. This is to allow us to upload files to Google Code using the Command Line/Terminal. 

**3.2. Create a Google Code Project**

This is where you will keep your content files. Go to File > Create a New Repository.

Choose the name for your project, give it a description and select a License for your content material. The most important step here is that you set **version control** to **Git**.

**3.3. Prepare yourself your project to upload your files**

Go to your [Google Code Settings](https://code.google.com/hosting/settings). You should find a password on this page, or generate a new one if need be. Keep note of this password as you'll need to use this at a later stage of this tutorial.

Remaining on this page, scroll down until you find the **Security** subtitle. Tick the box.

**3.4. Upload your content to Google Code**

Go to the **Source** tab of your Google Code project. You should be on the "Checkout" page. 

Copy the code on the page that will look something like: 

`git clone https://name%40domain.com@code.google.com/p/my-project-name/`

Open up a Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (Mac) window on your machine. Navigate to where you want to have your GoogleCode folder: in this tutorial we went to our desktop by typing "cd desktop" into the terminal window and pressing enter. 

Then, paste the code we copied from our project page, and hit enter.
This has created a folder where you can put your content files.

Place the file which you are going to use as your "iframe_url" in your Hangout.xml, in the folder that has just been created.

Currently, your content is still only located on your computer. We need to upload it to the Google Code servers! Go back to your terminal, making sure that you are within your Google Code Project folder ("cd my-project-name"), then type in the following, pressing enter after each line:


`git add .`

`git commit -m "Uploading my content files"`

`git push origin --all`

Once your files have been uploaded, feel free to close your Command Line/ Terminal Window as you will no longer need it for the remaining steps. 

**3.7. Accessing your secure files.**

1. Go back to your Google Code Project online
2. Click on the "Source" tab, then click "Browse".
3. Click on the file you have just uploaded. 

We need to access the raw data of this file. Go ahead and click “raw” like below.

You will be taken to a page that looks like the following:

**The URL above is what you can use as your iFrame URL!**

Copy and paste this into your “properties.yml” file back in the hangoutbuilder templating folder and run the application. You will now have a valid **“hangout.xml”** file which you can upload to your server and link to when you’re setting up your Google Hangout Application in the next section.
